#Section 1
This section covers what is terraform and why we should use it.

- Terraform lets you automate infrastructure provisioning to the cloud.
- Ansible, chef, puppet, saltstack focus on automating the installation and configuration of software.
- Terraform works wellwith these to configure the machines once provisioned.

Why terraform?

- Don't have to manually spin up and tear down infrastructure.
- Provisions infrastructure with the state that you want
- Lets you version control the state of the infrastructure.
